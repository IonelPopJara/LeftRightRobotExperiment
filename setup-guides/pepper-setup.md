# Pepper Guide

If pepper has not been set up before, you can follow [this guide](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-4/family/pepper_user_guide/first_conf_pep.html).

If that is not the case, you can just turn pepper on. If after turning Pepper on and pressing the button in its center it says "I can't connect the internet", you can use an ethernet cable to connect Pepper to the internet and set up a new WiFi network.

To do this, your first need to take out the pins located in Pepper's back comparment. Then you can insert the pins in the pin holes located on top of Pepper's head to open the ethernet hatch.

Once you connect the ethernet cable, you can press Pepper's center button again to listen for the current IP address. Put that IP address into a browser and log in with your credentials to set-up Pepper.
